# Fairplay

Fairplay is a decentralized no-loss prediction market protocol where users can stake on market outcomes without risking their principal. The reward pool is generated from platform fees, which are distributed to winning participants. Fairplay is designed to provide an engaging and transparent experience for developers and users, making it easy to create prediction markets, participate, and earn rewards.

## Features

* No-Loss Mechanism: Participants always get their principal back, even if they lose.
* Flexible Market Creation: Developers and users can create custom markets for any event.
* Developer-Friendly SDK: Simple integration for developers to add prediction markets to their applications.

## Smart Contract

## Developer SDK - Soon

### Frontend SDK

The Fairplay SDK allows developers to easily integrate prediction markets into their applications. It includes:

* React Components: Pre-built components for embedding markets.
* APIs: Simple APIs for interacting with the Fairplay protocol.
* Watermark: Optional branding to showcase Fairplay integration.

### How It Works

1. Create a Market:

* Define the question, category, and end time.
* Deploy the market using the Fairplay smart contract.

2. Stake on an Outcome:

* Choose between outcomes (e.g., YES or NO).
* Stake tokens with no risk of losing your principal.

3. Resolve Market:

* Propose an outcome after the market ends.
* Outcomes are validated and open to challenge to ensure fairness.

4. Distribute Rewards:

* Winning participants claim rewards from the reward pool.
* Losing participants get their principal back.

## Use Cases

* Sports Events: Predict outcomes of games or tournaments.
* Esports: Add prediction markets to gaming platforms.
* Social Trends: Forecast outcomes of real-world events.
* Custom Applications: Create prediction markets for specific use cases.
